# Navigation Placement Principles

## System Overview

**Single file controls both navigations:** `content/docs/navigation.yaml`

```yaml
- nav: Label              # Top navbar item
  subnav:                 # TOP NAVBAR DROPDOWN
    - section: Category
      items:
        - title: Item
          slug: path

  items:                  # SIDEBAR NAVIGATION
    - section: Section
      items:
        - title: Page
          slug: path
```

**Two navigation surfaces:**
- `subnav` = Top navbar dropdowns (quick access to major functional areas)
- `items` = Left sidebar (hierarchical document tree)

**Note:** Deciding what gets a subnav dropdown is IA judgment based on multiple factors - breadth of content, user entry points, strategic prominence. There's no single deterministic rule.

## Top-Level Navigation

Current structure (as of Jan 2025):

| Nav | Purpose | Subnav? | Pattern |
|-----|---------|---------|---------|
| Get started | Onboarding | No | Learning path |
| About | Product concepts | No | Conceptual |
| Connect | Connection methods | Yes | Task-oriented |
| Develop | Build applications | Yes | Technology-focused |
| Manage | Administration | Yes | Admin tasks |
| Postgres | PostgreSQL learning | No | Educational |
| Resources | Support/community | Yes | Utility |

---

## Placement Decision Process

### Step 1: Analyze Current Patterns

Before recommending placement:

1. **Search navigation.yaml** for similar content
2. **Count existing placements** (e.g., "23 frameworks in Develop ‚Üí Frontend & Frameworks")
3. **Identify pattern confidence** (high if 90%+ similar content in same location)
4. **Note any outliers** and understand why they differ

### Step 2: Consider Subnav Criteria

**Ask: Should this content be in a top navbar dropdown?**

Current subnav categories (Connect, Develop, Manage, Resources) share these characteristics:
- **Breadth:** Multiple distinct subcategories or technology choices
- **Frequent reference:** Developers access during active work
- **Known needs:** Users arrive knowing what they're looking for
- **Major functional areas:** Core workflows (connecting, building, managing)

Current sidebar-only categories (Get started, About, Postgres) tend to be:
- **Sequential/cohesive:** Linear learning paths or grouped concepts
- **Exploratory:** Users browse to understand, not reference during work
- **Less frequent access:** Read once or occasionally, not daily reference

**This is descriptive, not prescriptive** - use judgment based on content nature and user needs.

### Step 3: Recommend with Reasoning

Present recommendation in this format:

```
üìç Navigation Placement

Content: [Name]
Type: [Framework/Tool/Concept/etc]

Current Pattern:
- [X] of [Y] similar items in [Location]
- Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]

Recommendation: [Specific location in nav]

Reasoning: [Why this location matches user intent and existing patterns]

Alternatives: [If applicable, other valid locations with tradeoffs]

‚ö†Ô∏è Pattern Note: [If deviating from majority pattern, explain why]
```

---

## Subnav Patterns

### Pattern 1: Flat List (5-8 items, no grouping)
```yaml
subnav:
  - title: Status
    slug: path
    icon: icon-name
```
**Use for:** Resources, standalone utilities

### Pattern 2: Simple Groups (3-5 groups)
```yaml
subnav:
  - title: Group Name
    slug: path
    icon: icon-name
    items:
      - title: Item
        slug: path
```
**Use for:** Connect, moderate-sized categories

### Pattern 3: Sectioned (multiple technology areas)
```yaml
subnav:
  - section: CATEGORY NAME       # Uppercase in UI
    items:
      - title: Technology
        slug: path
        icon: icon-name
        items:
          - title: Specific Item
            slug: path
```
**Use for:** Develop, Manage (large categories)

### When to Create Sections

- Have 6+ related items
- Multiple technology categories (Frontend/Backend/AI)
- Functional groupings (Access/Projects/Monitoring)

**Don't create sections for <6 items** - use direct items instead

---

## Depth Limits

- **Subnav:** Max 3-4 levels (users can't scan deeper)
- **Sidebar:** Max 5-6 levels (supports collapse/expand)

If you need more depth ‚Üí create hub page or flatten hierarchy

---

## Common Content Type Patterns

| Content Type | Typical Location | Subnav? |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Framework integration | Develop ‚Üí Frontend & Frameworks | Yes |
| Language guide | Develop ‚Üí Frontend & Frameworks | Yes |
| ORM documentation | Develop ‚Üí Frontend & Frameworks | Yes |
| Connection method | Connect | Yes |
| Admin/management task | Manage | Yes |
| CLI/API tool | Develop ‚Üí Tools & Workflows | Yes |
| Architecture explanation | About (sidebar only) | No |
| Learning tutorial | Get started (sidebar only) | No |
| Support resource | Resources | Yes (flat) |

**These are current patterns, not rules.** If you find a better placement for specific content, recommend it with reasoning.

---

## Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå Creating sections with <6 items (use direct items instead)
‚ùå Nesting 5+ levels deep in subnav (users can't scan that deep)
‚ùå Inconsistent placement (similar content scattered across locations without clear reasoning)
‚ùå Unclear section names (users should immediately understand what's in each section)

---

## Handling Edge Cases

**When similar content is split across locations:**
- Present both patterns with counts
- Explain the difference (e.g., "Auth frameworks in Backend, UI frameworks in Frontend")
- Recommend based on content's primary purpose
- Note it's a judgment call for human

**When creating new category:**
- Propose where it fits in user journey
- Suggest whether it needs subnav
- Explain what type of content belongs there
- Ask human to confirm structure

**When patterns have evolved:**
- Note the shift (e.g., "Last 5 added to Location B vs. Location A")
- Recommend following new pattern
- Suggest updating this document if pattern is systematic

## Technical Details

**Icons:** Reference `/icons/docs/sidebar/` files
- Common: `frameworks`, `languages`, `orm`, `api`, `cli`, `auth`, `settings`, `support`

**External links:** Full URLs work in subnav
```yaml
slug: https://github.com/neondatabase/toolkit
```

**Tags:** Add visual indicators
```yaml
tag: updated    # Options: updated, new, beta, preview
```

---

## Process for New Content

1. **Read current navigation.yaml** to understand structure
2. **Analyze pattern** for similar content (count existing placements)
3. **Consider user needs** (frequency of access, breadth of category, known vs. exploratory)
4. **Recommend placement** with confidence level and reasoning
5. **Note alternatives** if multiple valid options exist
6. **Present to human** for confirmation (this is IA judgment, not algorithmic)
7. **Update both** sidebar (`items`) and subnav if appropriate
8. **Document reasoning** in commit message

**Remember:** Navigation organization is holistic IA judgment. Analyze patterns, understand user needs, but defer to human decision-making for placement.

---

## When to Update This Document

These principles describe current patterns and should evolve with the navigation.

**Update when:**
- 5+ similar items placed differently than stated pattern
- New top-level category added
- Major reorganization occurs
- Systematic deviation from patterns

**This document describes current patterns to guide analysis and recommendations.** Navigation decisions require holistic IA judgment - there are no deterministic rules. When in doubt, analyze similar content, consider user needs, present reasoning, and get human confirmation.
