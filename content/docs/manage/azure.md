<Admonition type="important" title="deprecated">
The Neon Azure Native Integration is deprecated and reaches end of life on **January 31, 2026**. After this date, Azure-managed organizations will no longer be available. [Migrate your projects to a Neon-managed organization](/docs/import/migrate-from-azure-native) to continue using Neon.

## Key benefits

Deploying Neon natively on Azure lets you manage your Neon organization alongside the rest of your Azure infrastructure. Key benefits include:

- **Azure-native management**: Provision and manage Neon organizations directly from the Azure portal.
- **Single sign-on (SSO)**: Access Neon using your Azure credentialsâ€”no separate logins required.
- **Consolidated billing**: Simplify cost management with unified billing through the Azure Marketplace.
- **Integrated workflows**: Use the Azure CLI and SDKs to manage Neon as part of your regular workflows, integrated with your existing Azure resources.

    <Admonition type="note">
    Management of Neon organizations, projects, and branches is supported via the Azure portal, CLI, and SDK. We continue to enhance the integration between Neon and Azure, including with other Azure native services. Additional Neon features and advanced configurations remain accessible through the Neon Console.
