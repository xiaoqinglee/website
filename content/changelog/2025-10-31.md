## Snapshots now in Beta with automated schedules

Neon's [snapshots](/docs/guides/backup-restore) feature has moved from Early Access to open Beta! This release includes a major new feature: [automated snapshot schedules](/docs/guides/backup-restore#create-snapshot-schedules) for Launch and Scale plan users.

![Snapshot schedule configuration showing daily, weekly, and monthly options](/docs/guides/snapshot_schedule_menu.png)

**What's new:**

- **Scheduled snapshots** â€” Automate backups with daily, weekly, or monthly snapshot schedules
- **Flexible retention** â€” Configure how long to keep automated snapshots

Snapshot schedules ensure consistent backups without manual intervention, helping you maintain reliable recovery points for your production databases.

## Postgres extension updates

We've expanded extension support for Postgres 18.

**Now available on Postgres 18:**

| Extension        | Version |
| :--------------- | :------ |
| hll              | 2.19    |
| pgcrypto         | 1.4     |
| pgjwt            | 0.2.0   |
| pg_hashids       | 1.2.1   |
| rdkit            | 4.8.0   |
| pg_roaringbitmap | 0.5     |

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

## Connect your app to Neon with a single command

We've introduced a new `npx neonctl init` command to help you quickly connect your app and enable the Neon integration in your Cursor chat. Run the following command in your app's root directory:

```bash
npx neonctl init
```

The command walks you through an interactive setup:

```
ðŸš€ Neon Project Initialization
Step 1/3: Configuring Neon MCP Server...
Step 2/3: Creating neon.md with detailed guidelines...
Step 3/3: Creating AGENTS.md for Cursor...
âœ“ Success! Neon project initialized.
```

After setup, you can ask your Cursor chat to "Get started with Neon" and it will have full context about your project and Neon best practices.

This feature is currently in beta for Cursor, with VS Code and Claude Code support coming soon.

## Neon Open Source Program

We're launching the [Neon Open Source Program](https://neon.com/blog/neon-open-source-program) to support Postgres-powered open source projects! If your open source project uses Postgres and is ready to grow, apply to receive:

- Up to $5,000 yearly in Neon credits
- Real cash payouts via GitHub Sponsors for referrals
- Promotional support to reach our 1M+ developer community

Applications are now open for projects that are publicly available under a recognized open source license, use Postgres as a core component, and are ready to scale.
