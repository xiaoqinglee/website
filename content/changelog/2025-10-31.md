title: Backup & Restore in Beta, Postgres 18 extensions, Open Source Program, and more
---

## The new Backup & Restore page is now in open Beta

The [Backup & Restore](/docs/guides/backup-restore) page in the Neon Console is now in open Beta. This centralized interface combines **instant point-in-time restore** with **snapshots** to help you protect your data and recover from accidental changes, data loss, or schema issues. Use instant restore to quickly roll back changes within your retention window, or create manual and scheduled snapshots for longer-term backup points. The Backup & Restore page makes it easy to keep your production databases safe without manual intervention.

**What's new:**

- **Preview data before restoring** — The instant point-in-time restore feature now includes a **Preview data** button that lets you browse tables, run queries, and compare schemas at the selected restore point before committing to the restore operation
- **Scheduled snapshots** — Automate backups with daily, weekly, or monthly snapshot schedules (Launch and Scale plans)
- **Flexible retention** — Configure how long to keep automated snapshots
- **Improved timezone display** — The date/time picker for instant restore now shows times in your project's region timezone, and snapshot names include the region timezone for clarity

## Postgres extension updates

## Neon Open Source Program

We've recently launched a [Neon Open Source Program](https://neon.com/blog/neon-open-source-program) to support Postgres-powered open source projects. If your open source project uses Postgres and is ready to grow, we'd love to hear from you.

Visit the [Neon Open Source Program page](https://neon.com/blog/neon-open-source-program) to learn more about the benefits and apply.

## AI-ready prompts for faster setup

We've added pre-built AI prompts to our integration guides to help you get started with Neon faster in your AI-enabled code editor. Simply copy a prompt from any guide and paste it into your AI assistant (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) for step-by-step setup assistance tailored to your stack.

**Guides with AI prompts:**

- **ORMs & Drivers**: [Prisma](/docs/guides/prisma), [TypeORM](/docs/guides/typeorm), [SQLAlchemy](/docs/guides/sqlalchemy), [Neon Serverless Driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver)
- **Web Frameworks**: [Django](/docs/guides/django), [Express](/docs/guides/express), [NestJS](/docs/guides/nestjs), [Hono](/docs/guides/hono), [Ruby on Rails](/docs/guides/ruby-on-rails), [Laravel](/docs/guides/laravel), [Astro](/docs/guides/astro), [RedwoodJS](/docs/guides/redwoodsdk)
- **Languages**: [Python](/docs/guides/python), [JavaScript](/docs/guides/javascript), [Go](/docs/guides/go), [Java](/docs/guides/java), [Rust](/docs/guides/rust), [Elixir](/docs/guides/elixir), [Elixir with Ecto](/docs/guides/elixir-ecto), [.NET](/docs/guides/dotnet-npgsql)
- **Java Frameworks**: [Quarkus (JDBC)](/docs/guides/quarkus-jdbc), [Quarkus (Reactive)](/docs/guides/quarkus-reactive), [Micronaut (Kotlin)](/docs/guides/micronaut-kotlin)

Each prompt provides your AI assistant with the context it needs to configure dependencies, set up environment variables, establish database connections, and create working examples—all while following Neon best practices.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Project dashboard**
  - The **Network transfer** metric in the usage widget on the **Project dashboard** now displays usage in GB instead of KB for improved readability on paid plans.

- **Private Networking**
  - Fixed an issue in the VPC endpoint restrictions view in project settings where assigned VPC endpoints were incorrectly shown as "Connection allowed: No" even when they were actively assigned to the project.

- **Vercel integration fixes**
  - Fixed an issue in the [Vercel-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration) where exceeding the data transfer limit returned a generic error. The error message is now clear and actionable.
  - Fixed an issue in the [Vercel-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration) where removed Vercel team members were not automatically synchronized with Neon organizations. Member removals and role changes are now properly synchronized by a periodic job.

- **Postgres extensions**
  - Fixed an issue that prevented installing the [postgis_sfcgal](/docs/extensions/postgis-related-extensions#postgis-sfcgal) extension.
