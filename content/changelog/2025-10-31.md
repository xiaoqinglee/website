## Snapshots now in Beta with automated scheduling

The [Backup & Restore](/docs/guides/backup-restore) page in the Neon Console combines **instant point-in-time restore** with **snapshots** to help you protect your data and recover from accidental changes, data loss, or schema issues. While the page remains in Early Access, the **snapshots feature has moved to Beta** with new capabilities for automated snapshot management.

**Snapshots (Beta):**

- **Scheduled snapshots** — Automate snapshots with daily, weekly, or monthly schedules (available on paid plans, excluding the Agent plan)
  ![Snapshot schedule configuration showing daily, weekly, and monthly options](/docs/guides/snapshot_schedule_menu.png)

- **Flexible retention** — Configure how long to keep automated snapshots before they're automatically deleted

**Instant restore improvements:**

- **Preview data before restoring** — The instant point-in-time restore feature now includes a **Preview data** button that lets you browse tables, run queries, and compare schemas at the selected restore point before committing to the restore operation
- **Improved timezone display** — The date/time picker for instant restore now shows times in your project's region timezone, and snapshot names include the region timezone for clarity

Together, these features help you maintain reliable recovery points for your production databases without manual intervention.

## Postgres extension updates

We've expanded extension support for Postgres 18.

## AI-ready prompts for faster setup

We've added pre-built AI prompts to our integration guides to help you get started with Neon faster in your AI-enabled code editor. Simply copy a prompt from any guide and paste it into your AI assistant (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) for step-by-step setup assistance tailored to your stack.

## Neon Open Source Program

We've recently launched a [Neon Open Source Program](https://neon.com/blog/neon-open-source-program) to support Postgres-powered open source projects. If your open source project uses Postgres and is ready to grow, we'd love to hear from you.

Visit the [Neon Open Source Program page](https://neon.com/blog/neon-open-source-program) to learn more about the benefits and apply.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Project dashboard**
  - The **Network transfer** metric in the usage widget on the **Project dashboard** now displays usage in GB instead of KB for improved readability on paid plans.

- **Private Networking**
  - Fixed an issue in the VPC endpoint restrictions view in project settings where assigned VPC endpoints were incorrectly shown as "Connection allowed: No" even when they were actively assigned to the project.

- **Vercel integration fixes**
  - Fixed an issue in the [Vercel-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration) where exceeding the data transfer limit returned a generic error. The error message is now clear and actionable.
  - Fixed an issue in the [Vercel-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration) where removed Vercel team members were not automatically synchronized with Neon organizations. Member removals and role changes are now properly synchronized by a periodic job.

- **Postgres extensions**
  - Fixed an issue that prevented installing the [postgis_sfcgal](/docs/extensions/postgis-related-extensions#postgis-sfcgal) extension.
